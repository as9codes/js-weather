In this code, replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap. You can sign up on their website to obtain an API key.

The fetchWeatherData function takes a city as a parameter and constructs the API URL using the city name and API key. It then uses the Fetch API to make an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API. Once the response is received, the function extracts the weather description and temperature from the JSON data and logs them to the console.

To use this code, make sure you have a working internet connection and include it in an HTML file along with the appropriate <script> tag. When the HTML file is loaded in a browser, the weather data for the specified city will be fetched and logged to the console.

You can expand this code to display the weather information on a webpage or add additional functionality as per your requirements.
